# Customer Churn Dashboard â€“ Tableau

Created by Nikhil Dev

## Project Summary

This Tableau project investigates patterns in customer churn using data from a telecom company. The objective is to uncover which types of customers are most likely to leave, and how factors like contract type, tenure, and services contribute to churn behavior.

## Data Overview

**Source:** [Kaggle â€“ Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)  
**Size:** ~7,000 customer records  
**Features:** Demographics, billing info, subscription details, and churn status

---

## Business Challenge

Churn has a direct impact on revenue in any subscription model. This dashboard aims to answer:
- Which customers are most at risk of churn?
- How do service types, billing methods, or contract lengths affect churn rates?
- What can be done to retain high-risk segments?

---

## Visualizations Included

### 1. Churn by Contract Type
-  Month-to-month plans show the highest churn rate
-  Recommendation: Introduce incentives for long-term contracts

### 2. Churn by Senior Citizen
-  Not-Seniors churn at a slightly higher rate
-  Recommendation: Offer better support for Younger users

### 3. Scatterplot: Monthly Charges vs Tenure
-  Many churned customers had low tenure but high bills
-  Recommendation: Focus retention campaigns on newer high-paying customers
